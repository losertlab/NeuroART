% EXAMPLES/LABVIEW
%
% Example showing how the toolbox can be controlled with LabVIEW.
% The example shows how otslm can be added to the LabVIEW/Matlab
% serach path and how the how a hologram can be created with the
% prisms and lenses algorithm.
%
% The LabVIEW interface is not yet complete and only contains the
% VIs for working with the OTSLM functions required for the example.
% We welcome contributions for extending this interface to be more
% compelte.
%
% The project has been tested in LabVIEW NXG 3.1.0.
%
% Files:
%   OtslmMatlabInterface (folder) - Example LabVIEW project.
%
% Files required for LabVIEW project:
%   callClassMethod - LabView helper function for calling a class method
%   initOtslm       - Initialize function for labview (adds toolbox path)
%   unpackCombine   - Unpack a NxMxK matrix into K NxM matrices

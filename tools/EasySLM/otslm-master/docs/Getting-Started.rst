Getting Started
###############

This page will guide you through getting started with OTSLM. This page
is split into three sections: `installation <#installation>`__, `using
the GUIs <#exploring-the-toolbox-with-the-gui>`__, and `writing
functions with the toolbox <#using-the-toolbox-functions>`__.

Installation
============

To run OTSLM you need to download the toolbox files and have a
recent version of Matlab installed (we tested OTSLM with Matlab 2018a).
There are a couple of ways to get OTSLM.  You can download one of the
Matlab toolbox files (with the ``.mltbx`` extension), you can download
a ``.zip`` archive containing the source code,
or you can clone the GitHub repository.
The advantage of cloning the GitHub repository is you can easily switch
between different versions of the toolbox or download the most recent
changes/improvements to the toolbox.
There are a range of online tutorials for getting started with
git and GitHub, for example
https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners.

Installing via Matlab Addons Explorer
-------------------------------------

If using Matlab, the easiest method to install the toolbox is using
the Matlab Addons explorer.
Simply launch Matlab and navigate to **Home** > **Addons** > **Get-Addons**
and search for
"OTSLM".  Then, simply click the
*Add from GitHub* button to automatically download the package and
add it to the path.
You may need to logging to a Mathworks account to complete this step.

Using a ``.mltbx`` file
-----------------------

You can download the latest stable release of OTSLM from either the
`GitHub release page <https://github.com/ilent2/otslm/releases>`__.
Simply download the appropriate ``.mltbx`` file for the relevant version.
Once downloaded, execute the file and follow the instructions to install
the toolbox.

To change/remove the toolbox, go to **Home** > **Add-ons**
> **Manage Add-ons** and select the toolbox you would like to configure.

Using a ``.zip`` or cloning the repository
------------------------------------------

The latest version of OTSLM can be downloaded from the
`OTSLM GitHub page <https://github.com/ilent2/otslm>`__.
Simply click the *Clone or Download* button and select your
preferred method of download.
If you are cloning the repository you can checkout different
tags to select the desired release.
Alternatively, for a specific version, navigate to the
`release page <https://github.com/ilent2/otslm/releases>`__
and select the ``.zip`` file for the desired release.

To install OTSLM, download the latest version of the toolbox to your
computer, if you downloaded a ``.zip`` file, extract the files to
your computer.

Once downloaded, most of the toolbox functionality is ready to use. To
start exploring the functionality of the toolbox immediately, you can
run the ``examples`` or launch one of the GUIs in the ``+otslm/+ui``
directory. However, for writing your own code, you will probably want to
add the toolbox to the Matlab path. To do this, simply run

.. code:: matlab

    addpath('/path/to/toolbox/otslm');

Replace the path with the path you placed the downloaded toolbox in. The
folder must contain the ``+otslm`` directory and the ``docs`` directory.
If you downloaded the latest toolbox from GitHub, the final part of the
pathname will either be the repository path (if you used ``git clone``)
or something like ``otslm-master`` (if you downloaded a ZIP). The above
line can be added to the start of each of your files or for a more
permanent solution you can add it to the `Matlab startup
script <https://au.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/startup.html>`__.

Post installation
-----------------

To check that ``otslm`` was found, run the following command and verify
it displays the contents of the ``+otslm/Contents.m`` file

.. code:: matlab

    help otslm

If you have multiple versions of ``otslm`` downloaded, you may want to
check which version is currently being used.
The following command can be used to check which toolbox
is being used

.. code:: matlab

    what otslm

OTSLM is implemented as a Matlab package, all the core functionality is
contained within the ``+otslm`` directory and can be accessed by adding
the folder containing ``+otslm`` to the path and prefixing the contained
functions with ``otslm.``.
For example, to access the linear function in
the ``simple`` sub-package, you would use

.. code:: matlab

    im = otslm.simple.linear([10, 10], 3);

Some functionality requires additional components. You can choose to
install these now or later.

-  `Optical Tweezers Toolbox <https://github.com/ilent2/ott>`__ (1.5.1
   or newer)
-  Python (2.7 or newer)

   -  numpy (tested on 1.13.3)
   -  theano (tested on 0.9)
   -  scipy (tested on 1.0)
   -  pyfftw (optional, for Fourier transform)

-  `Red Tweezers <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2013.08.008>`__
-  Specific Matlab toolboxes:

   -  Optimization Toolbox
   -  Signal Processing Toolbox
   -  Neural Network Toolbox
   -  Symbolic Math Toolbox
   -  Image Processing Toolbox
   -  Instrument Control Toolbox
   -  Parallel Computing Toolbox
   -  Image Acquisition Toolbox

-  Matlab MEX compatible C++ compiler

In some cases it is possible to re-write functions to avoid using
specific Matlab toolboxes. If you encounter difficultly using a function
because of a missing Matlab toolbox, let us know and we may be able to
help.

Exploring the toolbox with the GUI
==================================

The toolbox includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for many of the
core functions. The user interface allows you to explore the
functionality of the toolbox without writing a single line of code.
The GUIs can be accessed by running the OTSLM Launcher application.
The launcher can be found in the **Apps** menu (if OTSLM was installed
using a ``.mltbx`` file), or run from the file explorer by navigating
to the ``+otslm/+ui`` directory and running ``Launcher.mlapp``.
If you have already added OTSLM to the path, you can also start the
launcher by running the following command in the command window

.. code:: matlab

    otslm.ui.Launcher

If everything is installed correctly, the launcher should appear,
as depicted in :numref:`launcher-overview`.
The window is split into 4 sections: a description of the toolbox, a
list of GUI categories, a list of applications, and a description about
the selected application. Once you select an application, click Launch.

.. _launcher-overview:
.. figure:: images/gettingStarted/gui_launcher.png
   :alt: Launcher

   Overview of the Launcher application.

The output from various applications can either be saved to the Matlab
workspace or sent to a :class:`+otslm.+utils.Showable` device
(if one has already been configured).
Applications which generate a pattern have an option to enter a Matlab
variable name. When the pattern is generated, the image is saved to the
current Matlab workspace. Applications which take patterns as inputs (for
example, combine and finalize) can use the patterns produced by another
window by simply specifying the same variable name, for example
see :numref:`gui-data-flow`.

.. _gui-data-flow:
.. figure:: images/gettingStarted/gui_dataflow.png
   :alt: Dataflow in GUI

   Illustration showing dataflow between the GUI windows.
   A linear grating is generated with the name ``outLinear``,
   when the pattern is ready it is saved to the Matlab workspace (1).
   This pattern can then be used by other interfaces, for example
   (2) shows the same variable name being used as an input to the
   Dither application.

If an app produces an error or warning, these will be displayed in the
Matlab console.

The example applications show how the user interfaces can be combined to
achieve a particular goal. To get started using the GUI, work through
these examples. For additional information, see the
:ref:`ui-package` documentation.

It is possible to customize these interfaces, however creating custom
user interfaces in Matlab is rather time consuming and involves a lot of
code duplication. Instead, we recommend using live scripts, see the
:ref:`grating-and-lenses-livescript` example. It is also
possible to create a graphical user interfaces in LabVIEW,
for details see :ref:`accessing-otslm-from-labview`.

Using the toolbox functions
===========================

The toolbox functions and classes are organised into four main packages:
:ref:`simple-package`, :ref:`iter-package`, :ref:`tools-package`
and :ref:`utils-package`. To use these functions, either prefix the function
with ``otslm`` and the package name

.. code:: matlab

    im = otslm.simple.linear([10, 10], 3);

import a specific function

.. code:: matlab

    import otslm.simple.linear;
    im = linear([10, 10], 3);

or import the entire package

.. code:: matlab

    import otslm.simple.*;
    im1 = linear([10, 10], 3);
    im2 = spherical([10, 10], 3);

Most of the toolbox functions produce/operate on 2-D matrices. The type
of values in these matrices depends on the method, but values will
typically be logical, double or complex. Complex matrices are typically
used when the complex amplitude of the light field needs to be
represented. Double matrices are used for both amplitude and phase
patterns. Logicals are returned when the function could be used as a
mask, for instance, :func:`+otslm.+simple.aperture` returns a
logical array by default.

For phase patterns, there are three type of value ranges: ``[0, 1)``,
``[0, 2*pi)`` and device specific colour range (after applying a lookup
table to the pattern). Most of the :mod:`+otslm.+simple` functions return
phase patterns between 0 and 1 or patterns which can be converted to
this range using ``mod(pattern, 1)``. To convert these patterns to the
``[0, 2*pi)`` range or apply a specific colour-map, you can use the
:func:`+otslm.+tools.finalize` function.

To get started using the toolbox functions for beam shaping, take a look
at the :ref:`simple-beams` and :ref:`advanced-beams` examples.
The ``examples`` directory provides examples of other toolbox
functions and how they can be used.

To get help on toolbox functions or classes, type ``help`` followed by
the OTSLM package, function, class or method name. For example, to get help
on the :mod:`+otslm.+simple` package, type:

.. code:: matlab

    help otslm.simple

or to get help on the ``run`` method in the :class:`+otslm.+iter.DirectSearch`
class use

.. code:: matlab

    help otslm.iter.DirectSearch/run

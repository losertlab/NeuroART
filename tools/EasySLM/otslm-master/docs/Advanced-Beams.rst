Advanced Beams

This page describes the :scpt:`examples.advanced_beams` example.
This example
demonstrates some of the more complex hologram generation capabilities
in the toolbox including: combining multiple holograms, shaping the
amplitude with a phase-only device, iterative algorithms, and binary
amplitude patterns.

.. note:: Many of the images in this documentation include checkerboard
   patterns. The checkerboard pattern should have a width of 1 pixel to
   scatter light to high angles, however the lower resolution images shown
   in the documentation appear to have a courser checkerboard pattern as a
   result of a MoirÃ©/aliasing effect. To use these patterns, we recommend
   generating higher resolution versions using the toolbox.

Initial setup
=============

The start of the script defines parameters and functions for visualising
the far-field of the SLM. This is mostly the same as the initial setup
in the :ref:`simple-beams` example.
Some of the advanced
beams include a beam amplitude correction term to compensate for the
non-uniform illumination of the pattern from the incident beam. The beam
correction term is defined as

.. code:: matlab

    beamCorrection = 1.0 - incident + 0.5;
    beamCorrection(beamCorrection > 1.0) = 1.0;

Amplitude control with a phase device
=====================================

In the :ref:`simple-beams-lgbeam-example` and
:ref:`simple-beams-hgbeam-example`
examples in :scpt:`examples.simple_beams`
we noted how in order to create pure LG or HG
beams we need to control both the phase and amplitude of the beam.
In the :ref:`simple-beams-sinc-example` example we used the
:func:`+otslm.+tools.encode1d` method to encode a 1-dimensional
pattern into a 2-dimensional phase pattern.
For encoding two dimensional phase patterns
we need to create a mixture of two patterns: the pattern we want to
generate and a second pattern which scatters light into another
direction.
Common choices for the second pattern include:
   - a uniform pattern, which would leave light in the centre of the beam
   - a checkerboard pattern, which would scatter light into large angles,
     which can easily be filtered with a iris
   - a linear grating to deflect light to a specific point
   - another desired part of the far-field intensity profile

Creating a HG beam
------------------

To create the HG beam, we use the :func:`+otslm.+simple.hgmode` function we
used in the simple beams example, except this time we request both the
phase and amplitude outputs:

.. code:: matlab

    [pattern, amplitude] = otslm.simple.hgmode(sz, 3, 2, 'scale', 50);

To combine the phase, amplitude and beam correction factor, which
accounts for the non-uniform illumination, we can pass the amplitude
terms into :func:`+otslm.+tools.finalize`:

.. code:: matlab

    pattern = otslm.tools.finalize(pattern, ...
        'amplitude', beamCorrection.*abs(amplitude));

The finalize method generates a phase mask that is a mixture of the
desired phase pattern and a checkerboard pattern depending on the
amplitude. Internally, the method implements:

.. code:: matlab

    background = otslm.simple.checkerboard(size(pattern), ...
        'value', [-1, 1]);

    % This ratio depends on the background level
    % Amplitude must be between -1 and 1
    mixratio = 2/pi*acos(abs(amplitude));

    % Add the amplitude and mix with the background
    pattern = pattern + angle(amplitude)/(2*pi)+0.5;
    pattern = pattern + mixratio.*angle(background)/(2*pi)+0.5;

The final result, shown in :numref:`advanced-example-hgbeam`,
is something that looks a lot more like a HG beam than
the simple beams example

   This pattern accounts for non-uniform incident illumination.

Creating a Bessel beam
----------------------

A bessel-like beam can be created in the far-field of the SLM by
creating a annular ring on the device. The phase of the ring can be
constant for Bessel beams without angular momentum, or an azimuthal
phase can be added for Bessel beams with angular momentum. To create the
Bessel beam, we need a ring with a finite power and infinitely small
thickness. This is difficult to achieve, so instead it is better to
create a ring with a finite thickness, for this we can use the
:func:`+otslm.+simple.aperture` function to create a ring. We can replace the
regions outside the aperture with a checkerboard pattern to scatter the
light to high angles.
Example output is shown in :numref:`advanced-example-bessel`.

.. code:: matlab

    pattern = otslm.simple.aperture(sz, [ 100, 110 ], 'shape', 'ring');

    % Coorect for amplitude of beam
    pattern = pattern .* beamCorrection;

    % Finalize pattern
    pattern = otslm.tools.finalize(zeros(sz), 'amplitude', pattern);

.. _advanced-example-bessel:
.. figure:: images/examples/advancedBeams/bessel.png
   :alt: a better hg beam

   A checkerboard pattern is used to scatter unwanted light away from
   the desired beam.

Combining patterns
==================

There are multiple methods for combining beams. The phases can be added
or multiplied or the complex amplitudes can be added or multiplied.

Adding phase patterns
---------------------

Beam phase patterns can be added together at any time. This can be
useful for beam steering, for example, a linear grating or a lens could
be added to another pattern to shift the location in the focal plane. It
is often better to add the phase patterns before calling the finalize
method, since the finalize method applies the modulo to the patterns
which may introduce additional artefacts if patterns are added after
this operation.
An example is shown in :numref:`advanced-example-adding`.

.. code:: matlab

    pattern = otslm.simple.lgmode(sz, 3, 2, 'radius', 50);
    pattern = pattern + otslm.simple.linear(sz, 30);
    pattern = otslm.tools.finalize(pattern);

.. _advanced-example-adding:
.. figure:: images/examples/advancedBeams/addingBeams.png
   :alt: shifted lg beam

   A linear ramp, generated with :func:`+otslm.+simple.linear`, is
   added to a LG beam phase mask to shift the location of the LG beam
   in the farfield (right).

Superposition of beams
----------------------

To create a superposition of different beams we can combine the complex
amplitudes of the individual beams. To do this, we can use the
:func:`+otslm.+tools.combine` function.
This function provides a range of methods for combining beams, here
we will demonstrate the ``super`` method. The
combine function accepts additional arguments for weighted
super-positions and also supports adding random phase offsets using the
``rsuper`` method.
The following code demonstrates using the ``super`` method, the output
is shown in :numref:`advanced-example-super`.

.. code:: matlab

    pattern1 = otslm.simple.linear(sz, 30, 'angle_deg', 90);
    pattern2 = otslm.simple.linear(sz, 30, 'angle_deg', 0);

    pattern = otslm.tools.combine({pattern1, pattern2}, ...
        'method', 'super');

    pattern = otslm.tools.finalize(pattern);

.. _advanced-example-super:
.. figure:: images/examples/advancedBeams/super.png
   :alt: superposition of beams

   Demonstration of :func:`+otslm.+tools.combine` for combining
   two linear gratings using the super-position method.

Arrays of patterns
------------------

By adding a grating, such as a 2-D sinusoidal grating, to the pattern it
is possible to create arrays of similar spots. This can be a quick
method for creating an array of optical traps for
interacting with many similar samples.
The following example shows how a sinusoid grating can be combined
with a LG-mode pattern to create the output shown in
:numref:`advanced-example-grating`.

.. code:: matlab

    lgpattern = otslm.simple.lgmode(sz, 5, 0);
    grating = otslm.simple.sinusoid(sz, 50, 'type', '2dcart');

    pattern = lgpattern + grating;
    pattern = otslm.tools.finalize(pattern, 'amplitude', beamCorrection);

Selecting regions of interest
-----------------------------

Spatial light modulators can be used for creating beams and sampling
light from specific regions of beams for novel imaging applications. The
toolbox provides a method to help with creating region masks for
sampling different regions of the device. In this example, we show how
:func:`+otslm.+tools.mask_regions` can be used to sample three regions of the
device to create three separate beams.

The first stage is to setup three different spots. We specify the
location of each spot, the radius and the pattern. We use
:func:`+otslm.+tool.finalize` to apply amplitude corrections and apply the
modulo to the patterns but we request the output remain in the range
``[0, 1)``.

.. code:: matlab

    loc1 = [ 170, 150 ];
    radius1 = 75;
    pattern1 = otslm.simple.lgmode(sz, 3, 0, 'centre', loc1);
    pattern1 = pattern1 + otslm.simple.linear(sz, 20);
    pattern1 = otslm.tools.finalize(pattern1, 'amplitude', beamCorrection, ...
        'colormap', 'gray');

    loc2 = [ 320, 170 ];
    radius2 = 35;
    pattern2 = zeros(sz);

    loc3 = [ 270, 300 ];
    radius3 = 50;
    pattern3 = otslm.simple.linear(sz, -20, 'angle_deg', 45);
    pattern3 = otslm.tools.finalize(pattern3, 'amplitude', 0.4, ...
        'colormap', 'gray');

For the background we use a checkerboard pattern.

.. code:: matlab

    background = otslm.simple.checkerboard(sz);

To combine the patterns, we call :func:`+otslm.+tools.mask_regions`
with the background
pattern, the region patterns, their locations, radii and the mask shape
(in this case a circle). We then call :func:`+otslm.+tools.finalize` to
rescale the resulting pattern from the ``[0, 1)`` range to the ``[0, 2pi)``
range needed for the visualisation.
The output is shown in :numref:`advanced-example-region-sampling`.

.. code:: matlab

    pattern = otslm.tools.mask_regions(background, ...
        {pattern1, pattern2, pattern3}, {loc1, loc2, loc3}, ...
        {radius1, radius2, radius3}, 'shape', 'circle');

    pattern = otslm.tools.finalize(pattern);

.. _gerchberg-saxton-example:

Gerchberg-Saxton
================

The toolbox provides a number of `iterative algorithms <Iter>`__ for
generating patterns. One such algorithm is the Gerchberg-Saxton
algorithm.
This method attempts to approximate the desired light field by
iteratively moving between the near-field and far-field.
A more detailed overview of the algorithm can be found in the
:ref:`gerchberg-saxton-class` section later in the documentation.

In OTSLM, most iterative algorithms are implemented as Matlab classes.
To use the :class:`GerchbergSaxton` class, we need to specify the
target image.
Additionally, we can specify the propagation methods to use to go
between the near-field and far-field and an initial guess.
In this example, we setup a propagator with the incident illumination

.. code:: matlab

   prop = otslm.tools.prop.FftForward.simpleProp(zeros(sz));
   vismethod = @(U) prop.propagate(U .* incident);

and then create an instance of the iterator class.
:class:`GerchbergSaxton` also implements the adaptive-adaptive
algorithm via the ``adaptive`` optional parameter,
see the documentation for additional details.

.. code:: matlab

    target = otslm.simple.aperture(sz, sz(1)/20);
    gs = otslm.iter.GerchbergSaxton(target, 'adaptive', 1.0, ...
        'vismethod', vismethod);

To run the algorithm, we simply need to call run with the number of
iterations we would like to run for.
The run method returns the complex amplitude pattern from the output
of the last iteration.
To retrieve the phase pattern, we can simply access the ``phase`` class
member.
This phase pattern has a range of 0 to 2pi, therefore it does not
need to be passed to :func:`+otslm.+tools.finalize` before visualisation.
:numref:`advanced-example-gs` shows example output from this method.

.. code:: matlab

    gs.run(20);
    pattern = gs.phase;

Creating patterns for the DMD
=============================

A digital micro-mirror device (DMD) is a binary amplitude spatial light
modulator which consists of square pixels arranged in a diagonal
lattice. The arrangement of pixels means that the device has a 1:2
aspect ratio. Although the device can only control the amplitude of
individual pixels, it is still possible to create masks which control
both the phase and amplitude of the resulting beam.

In this example, we create a LG beam using a binary amplitude pattern,
following a similar approach to `Lerner et al., Opt. Lett.37 (23)
4826â4828 (2012) <https://doi.org/10.1364/OL.37.004826>`__. We need to
use a different size and aspect ratio for the DMD, for this example we
will use a device with 512x1024 pixels.

.. code:: matlab

    dmdsz = [512, 1024];
    aspect = 2;

To create the LG-mode pattern, we can use the :func:`+otslm.+simple.lgmode`
function. This function has an optional argument for the aspect ratio
and returns both the amplitude and phase for the pattern.

.. code:: matlab

    [phase, amplitude] = otslm.simple.lgmode(dmdsz, 3, 0, ...
        'aspect', aspect, 'radius', 100);

The DMD diffraction efficiency when controlling both the phase and
amplitude is fairly low, so we expect there to be a significant amount
of light left in the zero order. We can shift our LG beam away from the
zero order light using a linear diffraction grating. There are also
artefacts from the hard edges of the square (diamond) shaped pixels, to
avoid these artefacts we rotate the linear grating.

.. code:: matlab

    phase = phase + otslm.simple.linear(dmdsz, 40, ...
        'angle_deg', 62, 'aspect', aspect);

For this example we are going to assume uniform illumination. To encode
both the amplitude and phase into the amplitude-only pattern we can use
the finalize function and specify that the device is a DMD and the
colormap is grayscale. By default, the finalize function assumes DMDs
should be rotated (packed) differently, however we want to leave our
pattern unchanged for now and explicitly rotate it at a later stage, so
we pass ``none`` as the ``rpack`` option.

.. code:: matlab

    pattern = otslm.tools.finalize(phase, 'amplitude', amplitude, ...
        'device', 'dmd', 'colormap', 'gray', 'rpack', 'none');

At this stage, the pattern is for a continuous amplitude device. To
convert the continuous amplitude to a binary amplitude, we can use
:func:`+otslm.+tools.dither`. It is possible to do this all in one
step using one call to :func:`+otslm.+tools.finalize` but this
allows additional control over the dither.

.. code:: matlab

    pattern = otslm.tools.dither(pattern, 0.5, 'method', 'random');

Up until now, our pattern has been in device pixel coordinates. In order
to visualise what the pattern will look like in the far-field we need to
re-map the device pixel coordinates to the 1:2 aspect ratio found on a
physical device. For this we can use :func:`+otslm.+tools.finalize`
again, this time with the ``rpack`` argument set to ``45deg``.
We explicitly set no modulo
and a gray-scale colour-map again, however our pattern is already binary
so the output will still be zeros and ones.

.. code:: matlab

    patternVis = otslm.tools.finalize(pattern, ...
        'colormap', 'gray', 'rpack', '45deg', 'modulo', 'none');

The final step is to visualise the pattern. For this we create a uniform
incident illumination and we call the :func:`+otslm.+tools.visualise` method
with no phase.
The output is shown in :numref:`advanced-example-dmd`.

.. code:: matlab

    dmdincident = ones(size(patternVis));

    visOutput = abs(otslm.tools.visualise([], 'amplitude', patternVis, ...
        'method', 'fft', 'padding', padding, 'incident', dmdincident)).^2;

    % Zoom into the resulting pattern
    visOutput = visOutput(ceil(size(visOutput, 1)/2)-50+(-40:40), ...
        ceil(size(visOutput, 2)/2 +(-40:40)));

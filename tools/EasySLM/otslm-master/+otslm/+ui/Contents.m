% OTSLM/UI graphical user interfaces for exploring the functions in OTSLM
%
% These interfaces can be used to explore how the different functions
% in OTSLM can be used for beam shaping.  Most of the functions in the
% main toolbox have a user interface with similar inputs.
% The Launcher interface contains links to all the other user interfaces.
%
% To get started using OTSLM we recomend you start with opening the
% launcher and running a couple of the examples.  These examples will
% open the other interfaces.

% +OTSLM/+UTILS/+CALIBRATION functions for calibrating the device
%
% This sub-package includes a collection of methods for determining
% the phase-colour lookup table for a phase based SLM.
% Some of these methods may only work for particular systems.
% If you are unsure about your SLM, start with step or smichelson.
%
% Calibration methods
%   checker       - Generate phase device lookup table using checkerboard pattern.
%   michelson     - Uses images from a standard Michelson interferometer
%   smichelson    - Uses images from a sloped Michelson interferometer
%   step          - Applies a step function and looks at interference.
%   pinholes      - Generates virtual pinholes with different phase.
%   linear        - Attempt to optimise diffraction from a linear grating.
